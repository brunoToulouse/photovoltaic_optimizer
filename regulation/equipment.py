# WARNING: this software is exactly the one in use in the photovoltaic optimization project. It's tailored for my
#          own use and requires minor adaptations and configuration to run in other contexts.

# This module defines various equipments type depending on their control mechanism and power consumption profile.
# A brief summary of classes defined here:
# - Equipment: base class, with common behaviour and processing (including forcing and energy counter)
# - VariablePowerEquipment: an equipment which load can be controlled from 0 to 100%. It specifically uses the
#       digitally controlled SCR as described here: https://www.pierrox.net/wordpress/2019/03/04/optimisation-photovoltaique-3-controle-numerique-du-variateur-de-puissance/
# - UnknownPowerEquipment: an equipment which load can vary over time. It's controlled like a switch (either on or off).
#       This equipment is however not fully implemented as it has been specialized in the ConstantPowerEquipment below.
# - ConstantPowerEquipment: an equipment which load is fixed and known. It can be controlled like a switch.
#       ConstantPowerEquipment is essentially an optimization of UnknownPowerEquipment as it will allow the regulation
#       loop to match power consumption and production faster.
