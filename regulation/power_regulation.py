# WARNING: this software is exactly the one in use in the photovoltaic optimization project. It's tailored for my
#          own use and requires minor adaptations and configuration to run in other contexts.

# This is the main power regulation loop. It's purpose is to match the power consumption with the photovoltaic power.
# Using power measurements and a list of electrical equipments, with varying behaviors and control modes, the regulation
# loop takes decisions such as allocating more power to a given equipment when there is photovoltaic power in excess, or
# shutting down loads when the overall power consumption is higher than the current PV power supply.

# Beside the regulation loop, this software also handles these features
# - manual control ("force"), in order to be able to manually turn on/off a given equipment with a specified power and
#   duration.
# - monitoring: sends a JSON status message on a MQTT topic for reporting on the current regulation state
# - fallback: a very specific feature which aim is to make sure that the water heater receives enough water (either
#   from the PV panels or the grid to keep the water warm enough.

# See the "equipment module" for the definitions of the loads.
